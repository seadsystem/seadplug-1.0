 *
 * Event module.  Can create events, check for events, etc.
 * This ended up not being used except for the actions
 *
 * Use it like this:
 * action_ref a = new_action();
 * action_set_func(a, &foo);
 * node_ref n = new_node(bar, &delete_function);
 * action_set_args(a, n);
 *
 * Where foo is the function declared as
 * uint8_t foo(node_ref args);
 * And bar is any variable you'd like to use as an argument.
 * The node is a linked list, so you can chain multiple arguments.
 * delete_function is an optional parameter, it is the function
 * that deletes the value in the node, if it should be deleted when
 * you do delete_node(n);
